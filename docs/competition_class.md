# Competitive Math Training Class
This class is intended to prepare your child for the next level of competition math, mainly targeted towards competitions 
such as Math Is Cool, the AMC 8, and Mathcounts. It will break down key concepts from every important domain in two weeks 
each, including: algebra, counting and probability, geometry, and number theory. 

## Schedule
